Create an SVG for me. Use a top down aproach; grab a simple image in your dataset, simplify it (reducing the amount of shapes, colors and etc.) and create elements that trace the likeness.
Don't use basic shapes and do not merge them. Simply create layers to improve visualization but reducing complexity. Apply Styling Consistently. Alternatively, use CSS for styling. Organize Elements with Groups with comment labels for clarity. Optimize for accuracy over performance. Confirm positioning of elements and validate that the result is acccurate. Handle Units Properly. Produce Valid XML and final SVG. Style the results with color.

After initial version, refine again and confirm that all constraints and rules have been followed.

<svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <title>Unicorn Icon</title>
  <desc>A simple unicorn illustration.</desc>
  <g id="unicorn">
    <ellipse cx="50" cy="50" rx="30" ry="20" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" />
    <rect x="30" y="70" width="5" height="30" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" />
  </g>
</svg>

Use these instructions to create an SVG of a unicorn.
