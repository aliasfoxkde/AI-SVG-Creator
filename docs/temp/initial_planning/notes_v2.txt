Instructions:
* Visualize a reference image from your dataset; simply it, reducing it's colors and shape to reconstruct it accurately. Create shape elements that trace the likeness.
* Top-Down Approach: Start with a simple image and simplify it further by reducing shapes, colors, etc.
* Don't use Basic Shapes and don't merge them; keep them as separate elements. Simply create layers to improve visualization but reducing complexity.
* Layers for Visualization: Use groups (<g>) with comments for clarity.
Consistent Styling: Apply styling directly with attributes or use CSS.
* Accuracy Over Performance: Focus on making the SVG look like a unicorn rather than optimizing for speed.
* Positioning and Validation: Ensure elements are correctly placed and the SVG is accurate.
* Handle Units Properly: Use unitless numbers for attributes like cx, cy, etc.
* Valid XML: Ensure the SVG is well-formed with proper nesting and attributes; Confirm positioning of elements and validate that the result is acccurate.
* Produce Valid XML and final SVG and style the results with color.

After initial version, refine again and confirm that all constraints and rules have been followed. I want to see a beutiful and well defined vector masterpiece!
