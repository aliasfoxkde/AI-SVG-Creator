Framework around the AI:
* Create code that validates the SVG output and that it meets the constraints (otherwise send it back through)
* Use AI to analyse the output and refine if inaccurate.
* Once an "acceptable" version is made, send back through to do a second and third pass. Use the AI to analyse the image to determine if the improvements were made and that they are in-fact "better". 
* "Give up" and choose the "best" attempt after 5 tries.
* Repeat.
