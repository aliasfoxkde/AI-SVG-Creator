Visit the following URL, and create me a Kaggle starter Notebook for this project:

Use the Kaggle reference as guidance:

Do additional research and planning as needed.

SD model generates the image and writes it to a temporary file. It DOES NOT generate any code. No need to use matplotlib either. Keep to the constraints.
The Model's predict method would:
1. Use DeepSeek to enhance the user's prompt.
2. Use the TinySD (Stable Diffusion) model to generate the temporary PNG image.
4. Convert the PNG to SVG using image-to-svg.
5. Cleanup the "temp" folder
5. Return the SVG code.

Additionally, use LoRA and Vae to improve the output.
Use if __main__ block for best import/use practices.

Sample Promts:
A cat sitting on a cloud
Picture of a unicorn.
Butterfly flying around.
