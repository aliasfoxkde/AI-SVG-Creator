Example prompts (enhanced):
 A majestic silver unicorn galloping through a bioluminescent forest, its pearlescent mane trailing stardust. The horn glows with prismatic light, casting rainbows across ancient stone ruins covered in glowing violet moss. Tiny star-shaped fairies ride on its back, laughing as they scatter golden pollen. The scene is bathed in ethereal moonlight filtering through towering crystal trees, with a misty waterfall shimmering in the background. Style: Hyper-realistic textures blended with Studio Ghibli’s dreamlike whimsy, vibrant jewel tones, and soft cinematic bokeh. Mood: Serene yet awe-inspiring, with a touch of ancient mystery.

 A triumphant goose standing on an Olympic podium, wearing a gold medal around its long neck. Its wings are raised victoriously as rainbow-hued fireworks explode overhead. The crowd below is a mix of cheering animals: ducks in tiny Team USA jackets, rabbits holding ‘GO GOOSE!’ banners, and a teary-eyed coach bear clutching a stopwatch. Hyper-realistic, dramatic lighting with golden-hour sunbeams highlighting the goose’s feathers, cinematic composition, 8K detail. Style: Pixar-meets-Disney-animation with a touch of absurdist humor.

 A serene, whimsical scene of a fluffy, silver-gray Persian cat with luminous green eyes, curled contentedly atop a billowing, cotton-like cloud. The cloud glows softly with golden sunlight, set against a vast, gradient sky transitioning from warm peach to lavender at dusk. Delicate sparkles and tiny stars float around the cat, while the cloud’s edges shimmer with a faint iridescence. Below, a distant earthscape of rolling hills and a shimmering river reflects the twilight hues. The cat’s fur ripples gently in the breeze, and its tail sways playfully, blending ethereal translucence with hyper-realistic texture. Soft, diffused lighting creates a dreamlike atmosphere, rendered in a blend of anime-inspired fantasy and photorealistic detail, with soft pastel accents and intricate, glowing patterns on the cat’s collar
