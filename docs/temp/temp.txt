Example of endpoint:
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient(
	provider="replicate",
	api_key=""
)

# output is a PIL.Image object
image = client.text_to_image(
	"Astronaut riding a horse",
	model="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium"
)

Do additional research and planning as needed.

Steps:
Download Models:
https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B-GGUF/blob/main/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B-Q4_K_M.gguf
https://huggingface.co/city96/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium-gguf/blob/main/sd3.5_medium-Q4_K_M.gguf

Take in user message/prompt.
Enhance the prompt using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
Pass to prompt to Stable Diffusion and generate temporary image.
Use image-to-svg to convert image to SVG graphic.
Export the finale graphic to "out"

Improvements:
Use LoRA and Vae to improve the output.

Sample Promts:
A cat sitting on a cloud
Picture of a unicorn.
Butterfly flying around.
