# AI-SVG-Creator

## Demonstration (Examples)

### USE CASE: Generate an Interactive Story
While beyond the initial scope of this SVG generation tool, it could be very useful (think MCP, etc.) to create animations, 
video/short, game assets, reading book, or play-through storyline, and more.

- Instructions:
  Write a childrens story about a magical unicorn on a mission to visit the Sunset Village where she will learn to fly.
  She meets new friends along the way and tells them about her dream to fly, encountering obsticles she needs to overcome along the way.
  Stylize the story text with italics, bold, as well as add emoji's to add liveliness and character!
  End when she gets to the castle entrance of Sunset Village, with a kind message. 
  Then fade to black with a thanks to the reader, containing a placeholder to add links and other details.

- Generate SVG graphics of the following (so the objects can move independantly):
  - Create a title page on load with a mystical background and the name of the story in bold text (curved and animated).
  - Whimsical forest background (make it 10x the frame length; this will be used in a loop later)
  - A playful, cute unicorn (main character; clean with no background so it can be animated/rigged).
  - Create a bunch of "forest" friends for the unicorn to interact with along it's journey.

- Rigging:
  - Rig the characters so that they appear to be walking (bobbing, stepping, gravity, etc.)
  - Create the path of movement for all characters, background, etc.

- Interaction
  Combine and animate the SVG scene to create an interactive story with only forward triggers (forward arrow or spacebar) 
  like a powerpoint presentation as you progress in the story. As each scene loads, use dialog bubbles that are used as the 
  characters chat. Put a box at the top of the sceen with the narration (black background with white font).

- Progression:
  - Load the title page, wait 10 seconds and animate the Unicorn walking onto the sceen. 
  - Start typing the storyline out in chunks, at a slightly faster than reading pace, and read aload using TTS.
  - Add anything I missed and plan out the project before doing anything else...

- Future:
  - Allow the user to describe their own story.
  - Allow the user to input names of the characters to make the story more relatable.
  - Allow the system to "Generate a random story" with Button (user accepts it or can generate another, etc).
  - Generate all of the guidelines to create a story from only a description.
  - Add a timeline with edit features so the user can adjust the objects, storyline, add music, effects, etc.
  - Would it make more sense to do this with Scratch? And generate a "Game", or integrate it?
  - Download as video, svg or application. Option to "import" into Scratch (integrate/use Scratch-Optimizer)?

- Notes
  - The tool could be useful as a commercial product
  - This tool could generate all of your game assets
  - Could be used with 2D Game integration, platforms, etc.
